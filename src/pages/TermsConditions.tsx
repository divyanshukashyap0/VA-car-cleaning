            Welcome to VaCar Cleaning Service. By booking our mobile detailing services, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Service Agreements</h2>
          <p>
            By booking a service with VaCar, you authorize our crew to operate and clean your vehicle at the agreed-upon location. We require adequate space to perform our services safely. If the location is deemed unsafe or unsuitable by our crew, we reserve the right to reschedule or cancel the booking.
          </p>

          <h2>2. Payment & Pricing</h2>
          <p>
            All prices are subject to change based on the condition and size of the vehicle. Heavily soiled vehicles (e.g., excessive pet hair, mold, biohazards) may incur additional charges, which will be discussed and agreed upon before work begins. Payment is required upon completion of the service unless otherwise arranged.
          </p>

          <h2>3. Cancellations & Rescheduling</h2>
          <p>
            We require at least 24 hours' notice for cancellations or rescheduling. Failure to provide sufficient notice may result in a cancellation fee. VaCar reserves the right to cancel or reschedule appointments due to inclement weather, equipment failure, or staffing issues.
          </p>

          <h2>4. Liability and Damages</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-existing Conditions:</strong> We are not responsible for pre-existing damage, including but not limited to scratches, dents, peeling paint, loose interior trim, or faulty electronics.</li>
            <li><strong>Personal Items:</strong> Please remove all personal belongings and valuables from your vehicle before our arrival. We are not liable for lost or damaged personal items.</li>
            <li><strong>Damage Claims:</strong> Any claims of damage caused by our services must be reported within 24 hours of service completion. We will thoroughly investigate any claims.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Satisfaction Guarantee</h2>
          <p>
            We strive for 100% customer satisfaction. If you are not satisfied with the service provided, please notify the crew immediately or contact our support team within 24 hours. We will make every effort to rectify the situation.
          </p>

          <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            We respect your privacy. Any personal information collected during booking will be used solely for service delivery and will not be shared with third parties without your consent. Please review our <a href="/privacy" className="text-primary font-bold hover:underline">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.
